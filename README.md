# Syntax coloring for vcl and vcl.j2
## This Visual Studio Code extension adds syntax coloring for the Varnish (https://www.varnish-software.com) configuration language.

It's based on the language extension 'language-vcl' by jwfuller for the Atom editor (https://atom.io/packages/language-vcl)

The extension provides support for syntax coloring of vcl files and basic support for Ansible Jinja2 vcl.j2 files.
